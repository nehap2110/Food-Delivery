# 🍔 MERN Food Delivery App

A full-stack Food Delivery Web Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with a powerful Admin Panel for managing food items and orders.
The frontend was personally designed to offer a smooth and intuitive user experience. This project features admin and user authentication, cart management, order processing, and real-world backend architecture.

🧠 Built to master full-stack development, implement Redis for performance optimization, and apply clean, component-based UI design.
